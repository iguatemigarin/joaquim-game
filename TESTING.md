# Testing and Coverage Documentation

## Overview
This document provides information on how to run tests, generate coverage reports, and interpret the results for the `joaquim-game` project.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm run test
```
This command will execute all the Jest tests in the project and display the results in the terminal.

## Generating Coverage Reports
To generate test coverage reports, use the following command:
```bash
npm run coverage
```
This command will run the tests and generate a coverage report. The report will be available in the `coverage` directory.

## Interpreting Coverage Reports
The coverage report provides information on the percentage of code covered by tests. It includes the following metrics:
- **Statements**: The percentage of executable statements covered by tests.
- **Branches**: The percentage of control flow branches (e.g., if-else statements) covered by tests.
- **Functions**: The percentage of functions covered by tests.
- **Lines**: The percentage of lines of code covered by tests.

You can open the `index.html` file in the `coverage` directory to view a detailed coverage report in your browser.

## Test Structure
The tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory. Each test file corresponds to a specific module or class in the project. The following test files are included:
- `math.test.ts`: Tests for the `Vector` class.
- `stage.test.ts`: Tests for the `Stage` class.
- `ball.test.ts`: Tests for the `Ball` class.
- `world-entity.test.ts`: Tests for the `WorldEntity` class.
- `canvas.test.ts`: Tests for the canvas functionality.
- `loop.test.ts`: Tests for the `loop.ts` file.

## Writing Tests
When writing tests, ensure that you follow the existing structure and naming conventions. Use Jest's `describe`, `it`, and `expect` functions to define test suites and test cases. Mock any dependencies as needed to isolate the functionality being tested.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the development environment is set up correctly by following the instructions in the README.
- Use `npm run lint` to check for linting errors and `npm run prettier` to format the code.
